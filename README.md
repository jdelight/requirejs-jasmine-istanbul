requirejs-jasmine-istanbul
==========================

Testing how istanbul works with jasmine and requirejs

You'll need grunt and istanbul installed:

  `npm install -g grunt-cli istanbul`

To get started run: 
  
  `npm run dev`
  
Then open your browser to: http://0.0.0.0:9001/tests/specRunner.html

You should see coverage data in terminal.

To view the coverage in html (Lcov) format, change `text` to `html` in `tools/create_cov.sh`
